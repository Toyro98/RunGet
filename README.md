# RunGet
This was specially made for the Mirror's Edge Speedrun community on Discord. What it does, it looks for new runs every 5 minutes from an API. If it finds a new run id, it will send a embeded message to a discord channel. If it finds multiple new runs, it will send those too.

Before using this, there was a discord bot to look for new runs. It was a gamble if it would show a run or not. Now it will get every run that is recently verified.
